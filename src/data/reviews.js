        review: "The movie seemed pretty promising and had a pretty interesting idea. The characters were done pretty good as well. Although, the movie became messier and more forced as it went on and came to turn on it's head.",

        review: "A decent film. Mostly enjoyed the beginning and the fight between the Punisher and what seemed to be a russian offspring of Superman and Lois Lane, even though that was the goofiest part of the film. I just have really mixed thoughts about the movie and it therefore got an average rating from me.",

        review: "Good film with both an interesting and cool story with good characters, both heroes and villains, especially Doom. The film has both good funny moments and sad moments as well. The bad things are that the villain story arch was rather rushed and that there were unneccessary CGI at parts.",

        review: "A movie featuring the awesome character of Freddy Krueger. Although, the movie was a bit obnoxious and not very well edited. I also think it was an unnecessary remake, but that doesn't affect my rating as I try not to compare films to others when rating them.",
